<h1 style="center">Bloom</h1>

A positive reinforcement habit builder with a growth mindset. Find the live demo
here: [bloom](https://bl00m.herokuapp.com/).

This app is designed to provide an intuitive and encouraging way to build habits
and achieve personal goals. We are already hard enough on ourselves as it is.
Oftentimes what we need is just a small push in the right direction. That's
where Bloom comes in.

Through a combination of visually appealing rewards, an easy-to-use interface,
and sensible defaults, Bloom makes it easy to set your goals and achieve them.

## Technologies Used

Many technologies came together in the process of building this app.

### Backend

In the backend we used MongoDB for our database and Mongoose to define schemas
and models. We used JWT for authentication and BCrypt for password hashing. Our
server runs on Express, and we used Validator for validating input.

### Frontend

Our frontend is built with React and Redux. We used Axios to make api calls, and
all our styles are written in Sass. The jar was built with the p2.js physics
library. We also used React Beautiful Dnd for drag and drop functionality.
